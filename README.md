Google Scholarship FEND - Portfolio Site (Project 1)

The page at minimum includes all of the following:

* at least 4 images
* title text (h1, h2, etc.)
* regular (paragraph) text
* a logo

This project uses the [CSS Flexible Box Layout][Flexbox standard] ("Flexbox"), and img srcset to create a responsive layout.
Only the main image was implemented with srcset, but the remaining images are sized dynamically as the viewport changes, and are of a minimal size (compressed jpeg of relatively small resolution). An SVG was used for the logo (top-left of page), and expands/contracts within it's container.
